# Be Holy

**Helping people grow closer to the divine—however they understand it.**

Be Holy is an open-source initiative dedicated to supporting spiritual growth through goal-setting, progress tracking, and respectful engagement with sacred texts across all faith traditions. Whether you're reading the Bible, the Quran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Torah, the Dhammapada, or any other holy scripture, our tools are designed to help you stay consistent, reflect deeply, and walk your path with intention.

## 🌍 Our Mission

We believe that when people connect with their higher power—whatever name they give it—the world becomes more peaceful, compassionate, and unified. Our goal is to build tools that:

- Encourage daily engagement with sacred texts
- Respect all religious traditions and spiritual journeys
- Foster personal growth, reflection, and community
- Promote peace through shared spiritual discipline

## 📖 What We’re Building

- A cross-faith reading tracker for holy texts
- Goal-setting tools for spiritual milestones
- Journaling and reflection features
- Community-driven insights and encouragement
- Privacy-respecting design for personal use

## 🤝 Get Involved

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds—whether you're a developer, designer, theologian, or seeker. If you believe in the power of spiritual practice to transform lives and communities, we’d love your help.

- 🌱 Start by exploring our [issues](https://github.com/be-holy) and [projects](https://github.com/be-holy)
- 🛠 Submit a pull request or share feedback

## 🕊️ Respect and Inclusion

Be Holy is committed to honoring all paths to the divine. We ask that all contributors and users approach this space with humility, curiosity, and respect. This is not a place for proselytizing or debate—it's a sanctuary for growth.
